Standardized rebound side hops (SRSH)

Person jump on one leg lateral then directly medial back and then try to hold balance on one leg for 3s minimum.
Ten hop are done per leg, but unsuccessful hop are removed. Some have only five hop.

Data collected from three projects: ACLR old, ACLR new (FALCON) and EAGLE. FALCON is a follow up study that have T1, T2 and T3. ACLR old and EAGLE have only one testsession called T1 but is more equivalent to T3 in time from sugary. Time from surgery might differ between projects. Some controles/athletes have T1 and T2 for a reliability study.

178 metric variables
48 p2d timenormalized variables (24 lat + 24 med), normalized to 101 frames from landing to max knee flexion
8 EMG p2d timenormalized muscle signals (4 lat + 4 med)

U-Motion lab filetag description, example: 1102_F_P_sh_NA_p2d.txt
1102 = Subject ID
	1xx = ACL Injured from FALCON project
	11xx = ACL Injured from EAGLE project
	2xx = Control
	3xx = Athlete
F/M = Female/Male
P/At/C = Patient/Athlete/Control
D/ND = Dominant/Non-Dominant
A/NA = Affected/Non-Affected
R/L = Right/Left
T1/T2/T3 = Test session 1, 2 or 3

Acronyms:
lat -> Data between landing lateral and max knee flexion after landing
med -> Data between landing medial and max knee flexion after landing
mom -> Moment of force (torque)

_A_ stands for Affected leg, _NA_ is Non-Affected leg
_D_ stands for Dominant leg, _ND_ is Non-Dominant leg
usually A is compared with ND in analysis

EMG only on one leg, _A_ or _ND_

Exported data structure: 
Column list e.i. variables/trials added as columns after another. First five row describes the variable. For p2d text format row 3 and 5 are irrelevant.

Data issues:
Some timenormalized data might have missing values in midle of trial.
154 is Athlete 326 aslo, she got injured, probably don't use 154 as ACL Injured
128_T2 have no kinetics
124_T2 have no kinetics or EMG
153_T3 have no EMG
201 have no EMG
201 filename T1 is wrongly named T2 in first row of file, its T1
1106 have no EMG
1115 rep R/L_8,9,10 missing force/moment
